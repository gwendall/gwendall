The brain is a computer with limited RAM. 

When you have too many thoughts / cognitive tasks going on in parallel, you get slower and can burn out. 

AI allows you to delegate some heavy processing tasks - digging deep into this codebase, fixing that vicious bug, writing that daunting email. So you can better orchestrate what's running in your system. 

It doesn't replace us or make us dumber, it makes us supercomputers if we know how to use it properly. 

Don't delegate scheduling, just delegate processing. 

We're still the OS.

AI is just better hardware. 

Use the extra cores.
